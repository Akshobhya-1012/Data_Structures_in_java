# Data Structures in Java
 
This repository contains **from-scratch implementations** of core data structures in **Java**, with a focus on:
 
- Understanding **internal working**, not just using library classes
- Clean, readable code suitable for **interviews**
- Documented **time & space complexity** for each operation
 
These implementations help me revise quickly before interviews and also demonstrate my understanding as a **Java backend developer (3+ years)**.

## 📂 Structure
 
Each package focuses on a data structure family:
 
- `arrays` – Fixed & dynamic arrays, basic utilities
- `linkedlist` – Singly & doubly linked lists, operations
- `stack` – Stack using array & linked list
- `queue` – Normal & circular queue, queue using stacks
- `hashmap` – Basic hash map & hash set using chaining
- `tree` – Binary tree & binary search tree (BST)
- `heap` – Min heap & max heap (priority queues)
- `graph` – Graph representation, BFS & DFS
- (Planned) `trie`, `unionfind`, `segmenttree`, `lru`
